## Every Child Deserves the Right to Play

**IB Sports Foundation** is a not-for-profit initiative founded in 2022 built on a singular conviction:

> **Talent is universal. Opportunity is not.**
>
> **We provide the kits, the coaching, and the global mentorship to ensure a child’s starting point never defines their finish line.**

We bridge the gap between potential and opportunity. By working with underprivileged communities, orphanages, and children with special needs, we ensure that a lack of resources never keeps a child off the court.

Through structured sports programs, we don’t just build athletes, we build **confidence, discipline, teamwork, leadership, and a sense of belonging** that strengthens children in school, in life, and in their communities.

**Our model combines consistent coaching, mentorship, access support, and inclusive programming to create sustained developmental impact.**

## What We Do: Our Core Pillars

### 🏀 Structured Coaching & Adoption Programs
We adopt and support children from orphanages such as **Don Bosco Ashalayam**, providing consistent, professional coaching and opportunities to participate in competitions. Our programs run on a **long-term engagement model**, ensuring continuity, mentorship, and measurable growth.

### 👟 Removing Barriers to Participation
Financial limitations should never stop a child from playing. We provide:

* **Professional sports gear:** Full basketball kits and high-quality shoes  
* **Nutrition support:** Healthy meals and snacks during training sessions  
* **Community support drives:** Distribution of essential resources to families in need  

### 🎒 Life Skills & Education Engagement
Every session intentionally builds communication, resilience, teamwork, discipline, and goal-setting — skills that translate directly into improved school engagement and positive social behavior. We also organize **Gymnastics competitions and multi-sport training** to broaden exposure and keep children positively engaged.

### ♿ Inclusive Sports (The Sunday Center)
Our **Sunday Center for Special Children** creates a safe and encouraging environment for children of all abilities. We were honored to host **Ranveer Saini**, Special Olympics Gold Medalist, inspiring participants and reinforcing inclusive sporting values.

### 🌍 Global Mentorship & Coach Development
We bring global best practices to grassroots sports by inviting international experts to train both children and local coaches.

| Coach | Expertise & Background |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hassan El Saddique** | USA (All Dream Sports) & Argentina |
| **Naoufal Uariachi** | Morocco Men’s National Basketball Team |
| **Malkom** | Uganda & Rwanda Div 1 |

These interactions also strengthen local coach capacity, ensuring long-term program quality.
